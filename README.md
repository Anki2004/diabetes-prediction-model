Diabetes Prediction Model Using Machine Learning

About this project:   
The "Diabetes Prediction Model using Machine Learning" project aims to develop a predictive model that can assess the risk of diabetes in individuals based on certain health-related features. Diabetes is a prevalent and chronic health condition, and early detection can be crucial for effective management and prevention of complications.

The project leverages machine learning techniques to build a predictive model that can assist healthcare professionals in identifying individuals at risk of diabetes. The model is trained on a dataset containing health-related features and corresponding diabetes outcomes.

Build With:

Python
Machine Learning Libraries (e.g., sci-kit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch)
Data Visualization Libraries (e.g., Matplotlib, Seaborn)
Jupyter Notebook (for data exploration and model development)

Getting Started:

Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

Python (version 3.6 or higher)
Jupyter Notebook (for model development)
Required Python libraries (install via pip install -r requirements.txt) 


Data Collection:

I've included the data file 'diabetes.csv' for your reference.

Data Preprocessing:

Initially, a thorough examination of the dataset was conducted to identify and address any instances of missing or null data, ensuring data integrity and reliability.

Model Training:
In pursuit of achieving the highest predictive accuracy for diagnosing diabetes in patients, I employed a diverse set of classification machine learning models. These models included K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Trees, Random Forest Classifier, and Linear Support Vector Classifier (LinearSVC).
